# KevinBacon
The purpose of this project is to code the Kevin Bacon game!

This project tackles the important social network problem of finding an actor's "Bacon number". Starting with an actor, see if they have been in a movie with someone who has been in a movie with someone who has been in a movie ... who has been in a movie with Kevin Bacon. They're usually at most 6 steps away. There are plenty of other 6-degrees-of-separation phenomena in social networks.

Added boundary cases to prove code works. We also found the best center of the universe!
